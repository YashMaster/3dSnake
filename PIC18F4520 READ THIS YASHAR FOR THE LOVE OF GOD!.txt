For PIC18F4520 Programming: (this took forever to figure out)

Use the MPLAB IDE. It is magic.

Program the PIC, using MPLAB. If you don't you better set the configuration bits in the CODE.

#include <p18f4520.h>

All variable declaraitions must happen at the beginning of the code or you will get a Syntax Error.

"INTRC-Port on RA6, Port on RA7" (for use of an internal clock)
     Also "OSCCON =0x72;" should be the first line after variable declarations to set the speed of internal oscillator.

Make sure that you are using Release instead of Debug.



These settings must be PERFECT or it wont work. That took me forever god damn.

---------------- The code below WORKS if the settings are correct. ------------------

#include <p18f4520.h>

void main(void)
{
	unsigned int i;
    OSCCON =0x72;

	LATD = 0x00;
    TRISD = 0x00;


    while(1)
    {
        LATDbits.LATD0 = 0;
        for ( i = 0; i < 30000; i++)
        {
           Nop();
        }

        LATDbits.LATD0 = 1;
        for ( i = 0; i < 30000; i++)
        {
            Nop();
        }
    }
}
