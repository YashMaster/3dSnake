Snake is fun. 

3D Snake
============
Snake is fun. 
PICs are fun.
Nintendo GameCubes controllers are fun.
LED cubes are fun. 
If you agree with all of the above, this project is for you. 

This is a project I wrote for fun in college. It uses a PIC to interface with an LED cube. PIC also connects to and drives a GameCube controler for input. With these powers combined, it creates a fun and challenging snake game on the cube. Woohoo!
